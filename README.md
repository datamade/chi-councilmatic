# ðŸ‘€ Chicago Councilmatic

Keep track of what the Chicago City Council is doing.

## Setup

These days, we run apps in containers for local development. Prefer to run the
app locally? See the [legacy setup instructions](https://github.com/datamade/chi-councilmatic/blob/2e56e03cd689495899d8675ee97a65f672274cb9/README.md#setup).

### Install OS level dependencies:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Run the application

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Load in the data

Chicago Councilmatic needs to data work properly.

The `docker-compose-scrape.yml` file contains a service to scrape Legistar web API and
populate your database with standardized data on the council and its members,
legislation, and events. The default command scrapes all committees and people,
and any events and legislation updated in the last 30 days or scheduled for a
future date.

To import data:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-scrape.yml up
```

This may take a few minutes to an hour, depending on the volume of recent
updates! Once it's finished, head over to http://localhost:8000 to view your
shiny new app!

### Optional: Update the search index

If you wish to use search in your local install, add your shiny new data to your
search index with the `rebuild_index` command from Haystack.

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app python manage.py update_index --batch-size=100
```

### Set-up pre-commit

Pre-commit hooks are scripts that run on your local machine before every commit.

We use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework to run code linters and formatters that keep our codebase clean.

To set up Pre-Commit, install the Python package on your local machine using

```bash
python -m pip install pre-commit
```

If you'd rather not install pre-commit globally, create and activate a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in this repo before running the above command.

Then, run

```bash
pre-commit install
```

to set up the git hooks.

Since hooks are run locally, you can modify which scripts are run before each commit by modifying `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Testing

This app provides a basic set of tests that hit all endpoints for the bills,
people, events, and organizations in your local database and ensure that nothing
breaks. To run them, add some data to your database, as described in
[Load in the data](#load-in-the-data), then run `pytest` via `docker-compose`.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f tests/docker-compose.yml run --rm app
```
